These are some evaluations: I trained Megadagger for 500 iterations in three different modes: without any filter, with CBFborder and with both CBF border as well as agent. I needed to modify a bit the code for no filter because they applied a CBF border by default 

Average for:  
- no filter = 0.95654 
- CBF border = 0.723537906 
- both CBF = 0.685977011 

Number of saved checkpoints: 

no filter = 500 

CBF border = 277 

both CBF = 261 

Average Total Steps Before Removal: 

CBF border = 82.334 

both CBF = 81.564 

Average Total Steps After Removal: 

CBF border = 16.372 

both CBF = 15.792 

Average Ratio of Steps Removed: 

CBF border = 0.868536656 

both CBF = 0.871698614
